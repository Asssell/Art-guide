        <h2>Context and Influence on Art</h2>
        <p>"The School of Athens" is a monumental fresco that embodies the intellectual spirit of the Renaissance. Raphael’s use of perspective, with the vanishing point placed near the central figures of Plato and Aristotle, draws the viewer’s eye toward the core of the composition. The figures are depicted in dynamic poses, reflecting the philosophical debates and the exchange of ideas between the great minds of antiquity. The clarity of form and the use of space is masterful, and Raphael’s synthesis of classical philosophy with Renaissance ideals is evident in the way the figures engage with one another.</p>
        <p>The painting has had a lasting influence on Western art, symbolizing the triumph of reason and intellectual inquiry. It also serves as a visual representation of the Renaissance humanist ideal, merging art, philosophy, and science into a cohesive narrative. The composition has been studied by generations of artists and scholars, and its influence is still felt in modern depictions of intellectual exchange and scholarly pursuit.</p>
