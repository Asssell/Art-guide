        <h2>Context and Influence on Art</h2>
        <p>"The Scream" is one of the masterpieces of Expressionism, a movement that sought to convey emotional experiences rather than physical reality. Munch’s work captured raw, human emotion, and his ability to convey psychological states through art made him a pioneer of modern emotional expression in painting. The swirling skies and exaggerated forms of the figure reflect a deep sense of existential dread, which was influenced by Munch’s own life experiences, including childhood trauma, family death, and struggles with mental health.</p>
        <p>The painting's popularity grew over time, and it has been reproduced and parodied countless times. "The Scream" has become a universal symbol of anxiety, fear, and alienation, echoing the anxiety of modern existence. It is often used in popular culture as an emblem of emotional turmoil, and its influence can be seen in the works of later artists such as German Expressionists and even in contemporary digital art.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the painting’s distorted visual style and emotive power had a lasting impact on the development of psychological realism in art, which later inspired movements like Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism.</p>

            <h2>The History of The Scream</h2>
            <p>Edvard Munch painted "The Scream" in 1893, during a period of deep personal reflection and psychological turmoil. Munch’s own struggles with mental illness, the loss of his mother at an early age, and the trauma of growing up in a family touched by illness and death, deeply influenced the emotional intensity of the painting. The figure in "The Scream" is often seen as a representation of Munch himself, reflecting the internal distress and isolation he experienced. The swirling sky symbolizes the mental anguish and emotional chaos that Munch sought to express in his art.</p>
            <p>The painting has been recreated in various formats and styles, from oil paintings to lithographs, and has become a symbol of the anxiety and alienation of modern life. Today, "The Scream" is housed in the National Gallery in Oslo, though other versions are held in private collections and museums around the world. The most famous version, painted in 1893, was stolen in 1994 and later recovered, increasing its fame as an iconic symbol of modern existential dread.</p>
