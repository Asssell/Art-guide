        <p><strong>Year of Creation:</strong> 1937</p>
        <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Oil on canvas</p>

        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Museo Reina Sofía, Madrid</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> "Guernica" is one of Picasso’s most iconic and powerful works, created in response to the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. The large-scale painting is known for its stark black-and-white palette and its emotional depiction of the horrors of war, featuring fragmented and distorted figures that convey the anguish and chaos caused by the bombing. "Guernica" is not just a historical document but also a universal condemnation of violence and war.</p>

        <h2>Context and Influence on Art</h2>
        <p>"Guernica" was painted as a reaction to the brutal bombing of the town of Guernica in Spain by German and Italian warplanes in 1937. The painting’s emotional intensity, use of distorted forms, and its monochromatic palette make it a striking example of Picasso’s anti-war stance and his ability to capture the human cost of conflict.</p>
        <p>The work became a symbol of the suffering caused by the Spanish Civil War and later a universal symbol of the tragic consequences of war. Picasso’s cubist influence is evident in the fragmented forms, while the overall composition conveys a sense of horror, helplessness, and despair. The painting remains a powerful political statement, often invoked in discussions about the impact of war on civilian populations.</p>

            <h2>The History of Guernica</h2>

The bombing occurred during the Spanish Civil War and left the town in ruins. Picasso, deeply moved by the event, created "Guernica" as a political statement against war and fascism.
